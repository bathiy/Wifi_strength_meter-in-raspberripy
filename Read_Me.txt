This project is a Wi-Fi Signal Strength Meter designed to measure and analyze the signal strength of a selected Wi-Fi network. The current implementation is built on a breadboard prototype, with future plans for further development, including:

	1. Creating a PCB for a more compact and reliable design.

	2. Adding an enclosure to enhance durability and portability.

	3. Making the device movable for better usability in different locations.

	4. Generating a heat map to visualize Wi-Fi signal strength variations within a room.

This project aims to provide a practical solution for assessing and optimizing Wi-Fi coverage in indoor environments.
